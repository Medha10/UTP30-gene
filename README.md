# UTP30
UTP30 is involved with production of 18s RNA and
it is a U Three Protein.
Helps with the small assembly of small ribsomal subunit.
Also UTP30 is nvolved in rRNA processing which generates mature RNA which can be used properly by cells in the body.
Finally it participates in biosynthesis.
I put UTP30's coding sequence into NCBI blast with the entire nucleitide collection and there were many other coding sequences who shared a 100% match with UTP30. 
There was no similar match of UTP30 to coding sequences against the human genome.  
hello!
